// JSON object below includes: 
// Wave data table, where pgid is 3, pid not empty, objective is AHS-1.1
// Disparities data table, where objective is AHS-1.1
// This is the series(es) array, which gets called into the value of chart.series 
// series[0] is the disparities data
// series[1] is the WAVE table data, where pgid is 3, pid is not empty, objective is ahs-1.1, 
// series[1].

//GAAAAAh ok for now I think you should create the perfect JSON object (basically already done)
// then step 1 is make sure you can call that object into the series array, 
// and push in the additional highcharts-needed attributes to each series object, like "name" and "type"
// THEN get the chart fully functioning
// THEN, if time, work on a refactor that can pull the min/max out of the WAVE rows
